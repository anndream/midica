 * Objects of this class represent a specific MIDI channel.

 * 
 * The following elements of a channel's state need further explication:
 * 
 * - **tickstamp** - This is the current position of the parsed/exported file, counted in MIDI ticks.
 * - **relative volume** - Velocity of the key stroke. (This is relative to the channel volume)
 * - **staccato value** - That is the number of ticks that the key is released before
 *                        the theoretical end of the note.
