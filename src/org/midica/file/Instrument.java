 * - **tickstamp**       - This is the current position of the parsed/exported file, counted in MIDI ticks.
 * - **velocity**        - Velocity of key strokes.
 * - **staccato value**  - That is the number of ticks that a key is released before
 *                         the theoretical end of the according note.
