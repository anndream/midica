### Introduction
Midica is a MIDI composing assistant with a focus on music programming.  
It features it's own programming language for music.

So you can use the same techniques that "real" programmers use, including:
- Copy & Paste
- Macros
- Subroutines
- Modules
- Code Comments

You write your songs in plain text files using the text editor of your choice. Midica transforms these files into MIDI.

### Features of the Midica Application itself
- **Loading and playing** MIDI streams from:
    - Source code files (written in Midica's own programming language)
    - MIDI files
- **Integrated MIDI player** featuring:
    - Regulation of volume, tempo and pitch transposition
    - Memorizing a position in the MIDI stream and jumping back to that position
    - Channel Overview (showing current instrument and channel activity)
    - Channel Detail viewer (Note name and number, volume and tick, channel by channel)
    - Channel configuration (Volume, Mute and Solo configurable channel by channel)
    - Quick reloading and reparsing of a loaded source file script
- **Soundcheck View** for testing how different instruments sound with the requested note, volume and length

    - GUI language (currently English or German)

    - Half Tone Symbols (6 different systems)
    - Octave Naming - International (c0, c1, ...), German (C',C,c,c',c''...)
    - Syntax (2 different sets of key words for the programming language) - not _that_ important as the syntax can be redefined anyway in the music source code itself
    - Percussion shortcuts (English or German)
    - Instrument shortcuts (English or German)
